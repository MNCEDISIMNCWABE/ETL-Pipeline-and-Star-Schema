# Description
In this repository I explore the use of the ETL pipeline techniques to created a songs database for a music app. The database will to help the music app address business questions regarding its users, including the types of songs they listen to and the artists of those songs, using the available log and songs data. The database ensures a consistent and reliable storage solution for this data. This centralized data source is valuable in achieving its analytical objectives, such as identifying the most popular songs.
